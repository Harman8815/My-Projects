# Simple_Calculator
This is a simple GUI based project on java.
The above project is coded by Harman Deep Singh.

I have sucessfully tested the above project on:-

Eclipse IDE ver-2023


I have JDK version- 17 installed on my laptop but the above project uses libraray compatible with jdk ver-1.7. So change your jdk library before using it.You need not to Install jdk ver-1.7.
To run the setup in 
 # Apache Eclipse
 Simply import the project as a whole and run the Main.java file directly.
